# kickstarter-analysis
Performing an analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends 

## Overview of Project
After organizing her own fundraiser and making traget goals louise has hired an analytics 
firm to examine other successful and failed fundraising projects to provide insights into 
trends that may be of beneficial use within future projects. Our job as the analyst is to 
employ the use of excel visualization tools and formulae to organise the data into a 
user friendly format that is easy for the customer (louise) to extract information at a 
glance.

### Purpose
Preform a technical analysis using a variety excel tools and visualization techniques to
investigate the outcomes of different campaigns based on the relationship they hold
specific to individualized parameters (e.g. launch dates and funding goals)

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
An analysis of outcomes as determined relative to the theatres launch date revealed that 
there was a relatively low likelihood of cancellation thorough out the year. Though both
chances of success and failure seemed to move together with the highest chnace of success 
compared to failure seeming to be present during the spring/summer months. While this link
maybe causal die to the effect of a more pleasant climate, we cannot assume so as a correlative
link might also exist since the spring/summer months indicated a general higher average of 
hosted events.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
